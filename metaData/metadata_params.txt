{
  'run' : run number,
  'source' : the signal source (e.g. Na22 or LED pulser),
  'photosensors': the type and setup of photosensors used,
  'material' : the scintillation material used,
  'start time' : start time of command execution,
  'end time' : end time of command execution,
  'run time': requested duration of data-taking,
  'mode' : data-taking mode (QDC, TOT or mixed),
  'hwTrigger' : {
    'triggerOn' : if the hardware trigger was used or not,
    'type' : type of trigger (only option is 'builtin'),
    'threshold' : hw trigger raw energy threhold in DAC units (only works in
      QDC mode),
    'pre_window' : pre-event time window in units of clock periods,
    'post_window' : post-event time window in units of clock periods,
    'coincidence_window' : the time window to consider to events in
      coincidence; units of clock periods
  },
  'trigger_mode_1' : settings for t1 threshold trigger,
  'trigger_mode_2_t' : settings for first time stamp,
  'trigger_mode_2_q' : settings for integration start,
  'trigger_mode_2_e' : settings for second time stamp,
  'trigger_mode_2_b' : settings for integration end,
  'fe_delay' : delay line settings,
  'start temp' : the temperature measured at the start of the run. The sensor
    names are formatted "portID_slaveID_chipID_sensorLocation",
  'run temp': temperature readings taken throughout the run. Sorted by sensor
    type. Each sensor has a list with two value entries. The first value is the
    time of the temp reading within the run in seconds. The second value is the
    temp reading,
  'end temp' : the temperature measured at the end of the run,
  'BDV' : breakdown voltage,
  'OV' : over voltage,
  'LSB T1' : least significant bit settings for t1 threshold,
  'vth_t1' : t1 discrimination threshold in DAC units,
  'vth_t2' : t2 discrimination threshold in DAC units,
  'vth_e' : e discrimination threshold in DAC units,
  'step1 parameter' : the parameter scanned using step1,
  'step1' : step1 values,
  'step2 parameter' : the parameter scanned using step2,
  'step2' : step2 values,
  'status' : whether the run completed or not. If the was an error or ctrl-c
    was used this will say 'INCOMPLETE'
